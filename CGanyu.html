        <p>First appearance caused a lot of debate because of just how much damage she was able to output. Not only does her burst allow for AOE freeze, her weapon choices are versatile. Though her game play is somewhat lacking in diversity, if you are looking for a quick fight she would be the top pick. I rate her 10/10.</p>
